--MESSSAGE SENDING LOGIC IS ALREADY IMPLEMENETED, ONLY NEEDS FRONTEND MAKEUP--
send message from post form : send-message/ : send-message-api

url for creating a new channel: channels/create/

send invite to a user: invite/send/<channel_id>/<user_to_add> # user to add can be email or username

* by default, all users can speak to all users, channels between every 2 users are automatically created on signup;
* these channels are private, for styling stuff, you can use is_private variable in the channel-details-api to know if its a private messaging channel or a chatroom with a lot of participants
* (DONE)frontend should also not allow the user to invite others to private channels, backend will refuse the request anyway, but its best to hide it from user
